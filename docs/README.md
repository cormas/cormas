# Welcome to Cormas!

Cormas is a platform for agent-based modelling and simulations implemented in Pharo - a pure object-oriented programming environment.

Cormas was originally developed by the Green research unit (today part of UMR SENS) based on the years of field experience.
Cormas was specifically developed to support [Companion Modelling (ComMod)]() - a participatory approach that involves stakeholders in every step of model development and exploration.

Here are some key features of Cormas:

1. **Object-oriented language** - you will define your models with classes and objects. This makes it easy to reason about the models and also poweful to implement very complex models.
2. **Models are written in the same language as Cormas** - Cormas is yours. As you create your model, you can easily extend or modify the platform itself.
3. **Everything is an object** - and we mean _everything_! You can interact with agents, cells, charts, buttons, windows, numbers, classes, methods, date, time, the environment itself. Literally everything.
4. **Live programming** - change the code or interact with your simulation while it is running. No need to recompile anything.
5. **Powerful debugging tools** - you can browse the code and fix errors right in the debugger without stopping the simulation.
6. **Different points of view** - any agent or cell can have different visualization strategies (points of view) which can be dynamically selected, observed in parallel, or even distributed to different computers.
