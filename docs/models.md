## Old Models

Over the years, Cormas community has produced many wonderful models that are available online for the general public.
Some of those are simple models to teach agent-based modelling or demonstrate certain features of Cormas.
Others are more complex models that were created for various research projects and applied in the field in Europe, Africa, South America, or South-East Asia.
