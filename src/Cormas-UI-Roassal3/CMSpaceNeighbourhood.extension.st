	"Some figures like RSBox have origin in the top-left corner. Others like RSPolygon have origin in the top-middle. Return a point with the relative offset for the origin.
	
	For example, 0@0 means that the origin is at the top-left corner
	0.5@0 means that it's in the top-middle because 0.5 represents 50% of the shape's width"
